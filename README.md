# DestinyCrack
A website to gather all Destiny Cracking knowledge

## \#RaidSecrets pool of cracking info.
This repo is for the members of \#raidsecrets to share information.  I will add admins on trust basis.

Please fork the code and contribute back.

### Things that need to be done to get this started.

1. @alexdforeman to generate a full gradle project so people can run the code and modify it in an easy way, this current code was written on the train extemely quickly and I need to spend time making more accessible.  To use the current code please just fork or clone the project and load in Eclipse or jIdea or any editor of choice.

2. I want contributers, doesn't matter what, the WIKI can be maintained for all our current knowlede of curreny cyphers we have hacked, the code can be improved to be easier to use and try other theories.

3. Current theories on a certain code we are trying to crack can be maintained on the wiki, this includes stuff like [trying to use this](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Malbolge)

4. Id really like to make this a place for all knowledge on this, a dynamic document for all of Destiny 1 -> Destiny x's lifespan.   This project could die real quick but i know\#raidsecrets and I'm sure we can do something really cool.
